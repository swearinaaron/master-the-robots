## Development Workflow

### Git Strategy
1. Main Branches:
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `staging`: Pre-production testing
   - `develop`: Active development

2. Feature Branches:
   - Format: `feature/[feature-name]`
   - Example: `feature/course-editor`

3. Release Strategy:
   - Semantic versioning
   - Release branches: `release/v1.x.x`
   - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/[issue]`

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Local Development
   - Run with Docker Compose
   - Local PostgreSQL database
   - Environment-specific configs

2. Staging Environment
   - Automated deployments from `staging` branch
   - Test database
   - Feature verification

3. Production Environment
   - Manual promotion from staging
   - Database migrations
   - Backup procedures

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API
- End-to-end testing
- Performance monitoring
- Security scanning

### Documentation
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Setup guides
- User documentation
- Admin documentation
- Deployment procedures

## Current Status
- [x] Basic infrastructure
- [x] Initial deployment
- [ ] Authentication (partial)
- [ ] Course display (in progress)

## Next Steps
1. Fix current CORS/API issues
2. Complete course display functionality
3. Implement remaining Auth0 providers
4. Begin podcast system development

## Regular Maintenance
- Security updates
- Dependency updates
- Database backups
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback collection

## Current Focus: Course Display & API Connection

### API URL Configuration Attempts
✅ Final Solution: CORS + API prefix + Heroku config (2025-02-07)
- Backend CORS_ORIGIN set to mastertherobots.com
- Frontend VITE_API_URL set to master-the-robots-fe5cf20dff5e.herokuapp.com
- All routes use /api prefix

### Auth0 Configuration Attempts
- [❌] Default localStorage configuration - Storage access error in production
- [ ] Current attempt: Complete Auth0 setup
  1. Enable Cross-Origin Authentication
  2. Configure Google OAuth2 connection
  3. Update Auth0Provider settings
  4. Test with multiple providers
